# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub Profile 🌟

## About Me

I am a passionate researcher and developer specializing in **3D Vision** and **3D Point Cloud** technologies. My work primarily involves advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D data processing, computer vision, and machine learning. I have a strong focus on using **Python** and **PyTorch** to build and implement innovative solutions in these fields.

## 🧑‍💻 Research Interests

- **3D Vision**: Developing algorithms and models for interpreting and understanding 3D data captured from various sources such as depth sensors, stereo cameras, and LiDAR.
- **3D Point Clouds**: Processing and analyzing point cloud data, including segmentation, classification, and reconstruction.
- **Computer Vision**: Enhancing traditional 2D vision tasks with 3D insights, including object detection, tracking, and scene understanding.

## 🔬 Projects
