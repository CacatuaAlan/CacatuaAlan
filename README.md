# Welcome to My GitHub Profile üëã

## About Me

I am a passionate researcher and developer specializing in **3D Vision** and **3D Point Cloud** technologies. My work is primarily focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D data processing, computer vision, and related machine learning techniques. I strive to contribute to the community by developing open-source tools, libraries, and frameworks that facilitate innovation and collaboration in these fields.

## Research Interests

- **3D Vision**: Developing algorithms and models for interpreting and understanding 3D data captured from various sources such as depth sensors, stereo cameras, and LiDAR.
- **3D Point Clouds**: Processing and analyzing point cloud data, including segmentation, classification, and reconstruction.
- **Computer Vision**: Enhancing traditional 2D vision tasks with 3D insights, including object detection, tracking, and scene understanding.
- **Machine Learning**: Applying deep learning techniques to solve complex 3D vision problems, particularly in the areas of neural networks, representation learning, and data-driven models.

## Projects
